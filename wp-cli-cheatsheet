//Some of my common WP CLI commands

// The WP Importer plugin sucks, especially for importing images. The CLI does a much better job of this
wp import example.wordpress.2016-06-21.xml --authors=create

// Optimize or repair the database without the need of SSH or PHPMYADMIN
wp db optimize
wp db repair

// Export the database, again without the need of SSH or PHPMYADMIN
wp db export
or
wp db export yourname.sql

// Clean up post revisions
wp package install trepmal/wp-revisions-cli
wp revisions clean

// Remove spam comments - sometimes I go a long time without checking this in the dashboard, CLI does a much faster job at clearing it out
wp comment delete $(wp comment list – status=spam – format=ids)

// --all updates all updateable plugins.
wp plugin update --all

// Pretty sweet feature. Plugins that do the same thing may have more options but this sucker works!
wp media regenerate

// Make sure your core files are in tact
wp checksum core

// searches for and replaces strings in the database
wp search-replace
